# TikTok-youth-Camp
These are the stuff I did during the TikTok Youth Camp 2022!!! WHOOO

## Day 1:
Learnt about HTML/CSS. Not even just basics, but really in depth. Like everything there is to know about both HyperText Markup Language and also Cascading Style Sheet. LIke legitimately IDK how people new to coding and all this would be able to handle this lol. Like I've been doing web development for a long time and I have trouble keeping up. Like the HTML guy was using Emmet abbreviation. Bruh. Ain't no way newbies are folowing that quickly
